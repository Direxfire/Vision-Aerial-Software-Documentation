</h2>

## [Windows](/README_WINDOWS.md) 
- This is the easiest install as all programs run natively on Windows and do not require porting.
-There are a few issues with some of these software packages regarding the drivers needed. In the README for the Windows install are some helpful troublehsooting steps. 
    
## [MacOS](/README_MACOS.md) 
- This requires the use of a package manager, WINE, and some user configuration to allow all the programs to be able to run on MacOS.
- There are a lot of potential issues with this install and as a result, I have added as much support documentation as possible to aid in this. 
## [Ubuntu](/README_UBUNTU.md)
- This requires WINE to interrpret the windows programs. There are a few known issues with serial ports on Ubuntu with these programs. I have collected as much relivent infomration as possinble however, you may need to troublehsoot your own issues.
