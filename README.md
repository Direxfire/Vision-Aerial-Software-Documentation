<h1> Vision Aerial Software install Repository 
Select your computer operating system from the list below:
</h1>
<h2>
Required Software

1. Mission Planner
2. DPC-11
3. DroneCAN Gui
4. Gremsy GTune Desktop

</h2>

## [Windows](/README_WINDOWS.md)

- This is the easiest install as all programs run natively on Windows and do not require porting.
   -There are a few issues with some of these software packages regarding the drivers needed. In the README for the Windows install are some helpful troublehsooting steps.

## [MacOS](/README_MACOS.md)

- This requires the use of a package manager, WINE, and some user configuration to allow all the programs to be able to run on MacOS.
- There are a lot of potential issues with this install and as a result, I have added as much support documentation as possible to aid in this.

## [Ubuntu](/README_UBUNTU.md)

- This requires WINE to interrpret the windows programs. There are a few known issues with serial ports on Ubuntu with these programs. I have collected as much relivent infomration as possinble however, you may need to troublehsoot your own issues.

## To-Do
